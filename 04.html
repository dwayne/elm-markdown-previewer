## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Here's some code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.

```
-- This is multi-line code:
head : List a -> Maybe a
head list =
  case list of
    [] ->
      Nothing
    (x::_) ->
      Just x
```

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer/), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.

1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
