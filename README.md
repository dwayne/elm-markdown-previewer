# Markdown Previewer

![A screenshot of the Markdown Previewer](/markdown-previewer.png)

This Elm app is based on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s
[Build a Markdown Previewer](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer/)
front-end project. Its look and feel is "borrowed" from
[this example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/GrZVVO) CodePen app.

## Takeaways

To be honest I didn't learn much Elm by building this project. Elm made it
trivial to build the required functionality. Most of my effort was spent
recreating the design using my own HTML and CSS.

However, there are still some interesting parts for beginners to explore. You
can learn how to:

1. Use [elm-explorations/markdown](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/markdown/1.0.0/)
to [render GitHub flavored Markdown](https://github.com/elm-school/markdown-previewer/commit/74a77a09d892e9713abf96f7981b3d5b5eb50600).
2. [Edit and preview](https://github.com/elm-school/markdown-previewer/commit/4ca2369e731a82cb3d26f98c9d07d9db5d2ee32f)
Markdown in real-time.
3. [Maximize and minimize](https://github.com/elm-school/markdown-previewer/commit/0aff16d333b415ab060597b3f8c645e2d1cc0c00)
the editor and the previewer.

## That's all folks!
